# React Portfolio, multiple pages with dark mode

#### For my first React portfolio I used a template created by https://www.paytonpierce.dev/

This was another great challenge for me, i was able to take a template from a GitHub repo, navigate through the file and make changes where necessary. 

I had some issues with deployment because i hadn't run the build script to create the build file to deploy to GitHub pages. This was a valuable lesson because i was going about trying to create the gh-pages branch the wrong way. I also had some issues when deploying that it would link straight to the portfolio page instead of home, and when i would refresh i would get a 404. When refreshing the home page it would also return to my first initial blog page i created. 

By checking out some other repos that had forked this, i learnt about HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter, which solved these issues.
