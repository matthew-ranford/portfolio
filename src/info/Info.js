I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

  bio: "Hello! I'm Matt. I'm a Full-Stack Developer whose recently completed a 17-week intensive boot camp learning full-stack software development at Dev Academy. I've tried various roles in my life, none of them have stuck so this was one of the biggest challenges of my life, diving into the unknown. I still have a lot to learn, but I'm excited to see where my career in tech takes me!",
